	5. What is tight coupling?
	
	Tight coupling refers to a situation in software development where two or more 
	components are strongly connected and dependent on each other. In a tightly coupled system, 
	changes in one component often require corresponding changes in the connected components. 
	This high level of interdependence can make the system less flexible, more challenging to maintain, and harder to understand.
	
	
	6. What is loose coupling?
	
	
	Loose coupling is a design principle in software development that promotes independence and flexibility among components in a system. 
	In a loosely coupled architecture, components are designed to interact with each other through well-defined interfaces, and they have 
	minimal knowledge of each other's internal workings. This approach helps create a more modular and maintainable system.
	
	
	7.What is the purpose of application.properties file?
	
	The application.properties file is a configuration file commonly used in Java-based applications, especially those built with the Spring framework. 
	It serves the purpose of externalizing configuration parameters from the code, allowing developers to configure various aspects of the application 
	without modifying the source code. 
	
				# Database Configuration
				spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase

	9. What design patterns are used in Spring framework?



          The Spring framework incorporates several design patterns to achieve modularity, maintainability, and flexibility in application development. 
		  Some of the prominent design patterns used in the Spring framework include:

            -Singleton Pattern:

					The Singleton pattern is used extensively in the Spring framework. Spring manages the lifecycle of beans, and by default, 
					Spring beans are singletons, meaning there is only one instance per container.



			-Factory Method Pattern:

					Spring relies on the Factory Method pattern for creating and managing beans. Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI) 
					in Spring are facilitated through factory methods.
					
			-Prototype Pattern:

					While the default scope for Spring beans is singleton, the framework also supports the Prototype pattern. Beans with the prototype scope
					create a new instance every time they are requested.

			-Builder Pattern:

					Spring often uses the Builder pattern for constructing complex objects. For example, when configuring beans in Java-based configuration 
					classes or when building query objects in the Spring Data module.
					
			-Decorator Pattern:

					The Decorator pattern is employed in Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming). AOP allows developers to separate cross-cutting concerns 
					like logging and security from the main business logic, and this is achieved using decorators called aspects.

			-Proxy Pattern:

					Spring AOP also leverages the Proxy pattern. Spring creates dynamic proxies to implement aspects and achieve method interception for 
					cross-cutting concerns.
					
			-Observer Pattern:

					The Observer pattern is applied in the Spring event handling mechanism. Components can register as listeners for specific events, 
					and when an event occurs, the registered listeners are notified.
					
			-Template Method Pattern:

					The Template Method pattern is employed in various parts of the Spring framework, such as the JDBC template and Hibernate template.
					These templates provide a standardized way of performing common tasks, allowing customization through method callbacks.

			-Strategy Pattern:

					The Strategy pattern is used in the Spring framework's support for different transaction management strategies. 
					Developers can choose between different transaction management strategies, such as local transactions, JTA, etc., based on their requirements.

			-Command Pattern:

					The Command pattern is used in Spring's Core Container. For example, when configuring beans using XML or Java-based configuration, 
					developers provide commands for creating and configuring objects, and Spring carries out these commands during the initialization phase.

			-Composite Pattern:

					The Composite pattern is utilized in the Spring framework's support for handling complex hierarchical structures. For example, in the context
					of ApplicationContext, the container is a composite of beans.

			These design patterns contribute to the overall architecture and features of the Spring framework, promoting best practices in software design and
			development. The use of these patterns enhances code readability, maintainability, and flexibility in building enterprise-level applications.


10 . What are some of the best practices for Spring Framework?

 
		When working with the Spring Framework, adopting best practices helps ensure efficient development, maintainability, and scalability of your applications. 
		Here are some recommended best practices for using the Spring Framework:

			-Follow the Dependency Injection (DI) Principle:

						Leverage the Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection features of Spring. 
						Design classes and components with a clear separation of concerns, allowing Spring to manage dependencies.
						
						
			-Use Spring Boot for Simplified Configuration:

						Consider using Spring Boot for new projects. Spring Boot simplifies the configuration process, automatically configuring 
						common settings based on sensible defaults. It reduces boilerplate code and allows for rapid development.

			-Keep Configuration Externalized:

						Externalize configuration using properties files (e.g., application.properties or application.yml).
						Avoid hardcoding configuration values in the code, and use placeholders for dynamic configuration.
						
			-Leverage Annotations for Configuration:

					Use annotations (e.g., @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller) for bean configuration. 
					This enhances code readability and reduces the need for extensive XML configuration.

			-Use Constructor Injection:

					Prefer constructor injection over setter injection when injecting dependencies into Spring beans. 
					Constructor injection ensures that the required dependencies are available when the bean is created.
					
			-Apply Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) for Cross-Cutting Concerns:

					Use AOP to separate cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transactions. Define aspects and apply them where needed, 
					promoting cleaner and more modular code.
					
			-Keep Business Logic in Service Layer:

					Structure your application with a clear separation of concerns. Place business logic in service classes, keeping controllers thin 
					and focused on handling requests and responses.
					
			-Use Spring Data Repositories:

					Leverage Spring Data repositories for database interactions. Spring Data simplifies data access and reduces boilerplate code, 
					supporting various database technologies.
					
			-Apply Validation and Exception Handling:

					Implement validation using Spring's validation framework (@Valid and @Validated). Handle exceptions gracefully, providing meaningful 
					error messages and using Spring's exception handling mechanisms.
					
			-Use Spring MVC for Web Applications:

					If building web applications, follow best practices for Spring MVC. Design RESTful APIs, use appropriate HTTP methods,
					and organize controllers, services, and views logically.
					
			-Implement Caching:

					Use Spring's caching annotations (@Cacheable, @CacheEvict, etc.) to improve performance by caching expensive operations or 
					frequently accessed data.
					
			-Apply Transaction Management:

					Define transactions using Spring's declarative transaction management (@Transactional). Ensure proper handling of transactions
					to maintain data integrity.
				
			-Write Unit Tests:

					Emphasize unit testing using frameworks like JUnit. Leverage the Spring Test module for testing Spring components. 
					Write tests for controllers, services, and repositories to ensure the correctness of your code.
					
			-Secure Your Application:

					Implement security best practices using Spring Security. Secure your application by configuring authentication, authorization, 
					and protection against common security vulnerabilities.
			
			-Monitor and Optimize Performance:

					Monitor your Spring applications using tools like Spring Boot Actuator. Optimize performance by identifying and addressing bottlenecks,
					and consider using caching and asynchronous processing where applicable.
					
			-Document Your Code:

					Maintain thorough documentation for your Spring applications. Use tools like Swagger for documenting REST APIs.
					Well-documented code facilitates collaboration and understanding, especially for large codebases.

			Adhering to these best practices helps ensure a more maintainable, scalable, and robust Spring application.
			Keep in mind that best practices may evolve with new Spring releases and changes in industry standards, so staying informed is crucial.
