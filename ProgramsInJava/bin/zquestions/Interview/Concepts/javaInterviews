 ##Explain Bubble sort.
 
 * compares each pair of adjacent items, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
   This process is repeated for each element in the list until the entire list is sorted.
   It is not efficient for large lists but can be practical for small datasets or educational
   purposes.
